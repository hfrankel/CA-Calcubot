puts "Chapter 5

Meeting with The Oracle. The Oracle says she will tell Calcubot how to get home.
But for a price. She wants his gold antenna for her collection of rare items.

\"How can you see my antenna?\"

\"I'm The Oracle...\"

OPTIONS:
(1) passionately plea with the Oracle to give answer without giving up antenna
(2) give up gold antenna
(3) fight The Oracle

The Oracle does not know exactly where Calcubot must go to return home but she
has a feeling that the answer to that question can be found at
Shady Pines in Bladderpool."
