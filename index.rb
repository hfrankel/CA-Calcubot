2066

The mad scientist Dr. Henrikh Finklefeinstein has launched his latest
invention.

Calcubot.

Calcubot is a blank robot, designed to learn surrounding behaviour.

One day in Dr. Finklefeinstein's lab, he is playing catch with Calcubot.
Calcubot has recently spent time watching dog videos on YouTube and so when
Dr. Finklefeinstein throws the ball at pace across the room, Calcubot chases it
like a lunatic.

Unfortunately for Calcubot and Dr. Finklefeinstein, the robot slams into the
doctor's time & universe machine sitting in the corner and engages
the time mechanism.

Calcubot is sent back in time 1000 years to an alternate universe..."

What is that thing?!

Whittaker Forest, Angland

Alouise takes Calcubot to her home. They make a plan on how to get Calcubot
back to its world. Alouise agrees to accompany Calcubot and cast a spell to
make it appear as a human. After struggling to make a solid plan, Alouise
suggests that they see The Oracle, a dangerous and powerful being.

On the way out, Calcubot notices a strange item on a broken shelf.

OPTIONS:
(1) repair shelf
(2) leave

In the woods on the way to the Oracle. An aggressive, wild bear approaches.

puts "Chapter 5

Meeting with The Oracle. The Oracle says she will tell Calcubot how to get home.
But for a price. She wants his gold antenna for her collection of rare items.

\"How can you see my antenna?\"

\"I'm The Oracle...\"

OPTIONS:
(1) passionately plea with the Oracle to give answer without giving up antenna
(2) give up gold antenna
(3) fight The Oracle

The Oracle does not know exactly where Calcubot must go to return home but she
has a feeling that the answer to that question can be found at
Shady Pines in Bladderpool."

puts "Chapter 6

Our gang find themselves in Bladderpool. Alouise says she is going to go to
the Shady Pines Tavern to try get more information. She tells Calcubot to
stay where he is and not interact with anyone. Calcubot is looking around and
sees an old man motion towards him. Calcubot approaches.

The old man has a classic shell game in front of him and asks if Calcubot
wants to play. The min fee is 1 item and the old man will double whatever the
player gambles. An impossibly large younger man makes his way to
the shell game table.

\"Well Dad, looks like we got a player here. Sir, what's it gonna be?\"

OPTIONS:
(1) Politely decline
(2) Gamble with money you don't have
(3) Gamble with money you don't have

Meet back up with Alouise who has more information. It is as Alouise feared.
There is only one item in Yourope that might be able to help. That is
Schvaytee's Pocketwatch. A powerful watch that can manipulate time. It is
in the posession of the Daemon, Greg on the Isle of Dawn.

We must find a ship that can take us. The closest port is at Portsmath.
Calcubot and Alouise head to Portsmath."

puts "Chapter 7

Portsmath, Angland

Calcubot and Alouise start their search at Shipmaster's Gate, where they come
across the Shipmaster.

\"I'm sorry but there are no vessles that go to the Isle of Dawn. You will have
to find your own or somehow convince one of those mad bastards down by Shawshank
Docks to take you ...and they take a lot of convincing.\"

\"I'm sure we can work something out.\"

\"Try Ol' Gammy leg. She'd be the only one to dare do it.\"

At the docks... Calcubot spots what looks to be Ol Gammy Leg.

OPTIONS:
(1) Catch up to \"Ol' Gammy Leg\" and politely ask for her help
(2) Shout \"Ol' Gammy Leg!\" then ask for her help
(3) Shout \"Oi!\" and whistle at Gammy then demand her help"

puts "Chapter 8

Isle of Dawn, off Angland Coast

Alouise and Calcubot wade through a thick jungle.

They spot light in the distance. It's coming from a small tavern. They enter.

A bedraggled man is sitting alone at the bar. The only company present. He
reaches into his coat and pulls out a pointy metallic object with a wooden
handle. Sticking it right into Calcubot's face, he pulls his thumb back and the
device clicks.

\"What is that?\" blurts Alouise.

\"A weapon that hasn't been invented for 300 years,\" responds Calcubot.

\"The machine knows.\" Greg puts away the device. \"You can have the watch.\"

\"Why are you just giving it to us?\"

\"Just take it!!!\" screams the daemon. \"It is cursed.\"

Calcubot takes the watch from Greg.

OPTION:
(1) equip Schvaytee's Pocketwatch

Calcubot and Alouise exit."

Isle of Dawn, off Angland Coast

Calcubot and Alouise are heading back to Gammy's ship.

\"The watch please?\"

Calcubot turns and Alouise has her staff pointed at in its direction.

\"Why?\"

\"Let's just say I don't enjoy the threat of being burned at the stake.
I figure I'll take my chances in some other time period.\"

Calcubot is frozen.

\"Now!\"

OPTIONS:
(1) try talk Alouise into letting you keep the pocketwatch
(2) fight Alouise [EXT]"
