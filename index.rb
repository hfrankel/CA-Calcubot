puts "The mad scientist Dr. Henrikh Finklefeinstein has launched his latest
invention.\n
Calcubot.\n
Calcubot is a blank robot, designed to learn surrounding behaviour.\n
One day in Dr. Finklefeinstein's lab, he is playing catch with Calcubot.
Calcubot has recently spent time watching dog videos on YouTube and so when
Dr. Finklefeinstein throws the ball at pace across the room, Calcubot chases it
like a lunatic.\n
Unfortunately for Calcubot and Dr. Finklefeinstein, the robot slams into the
doctor's time & universe machine sitting in the corner and engages
the time mechanism.\n
Calcubot is sent back in time 1000 years to an alternate universe...\n"
