puts "Chapter 8

Isle of Dawn, off Angland Coast

Alouise and Calcubot wade through a thick jungle.

They spot light in the distance. It's coming from a small tavern. They enter.

A bedraggled man is sitting alone at the bar. The only company present. He
reaches into his coat and pulls out a pointy metallic object with a wooden
handle. Sticking it right into Calcubot's face, he pulls his thumb back and the
device clicks.

\"What is that?\" blurts Alouise.

\"A weapon that hasn't been invented for 300 years,\" responds Calcubot.

\"The machine knows.\" Greg puts away the device. \"You can have the watch.\"

\"Why are you just giving it to us?\"

\"Just take it!!!\" screams the daemon. \"It is cursed.\"

Calcubot takes the watch from Greg.

OPTION:
(1) equip Schvaytee's Pocketwatch

Calcubot and Alouise exit."
