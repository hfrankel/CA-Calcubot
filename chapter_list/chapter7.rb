Portsmath, Angland

Calcubot and Alouise start their search at Shipmaster's Gate, where they come
across the Shipmaster.

\"I'm sorry but there are no vessles that go to the Isle of Dawn. You will have
to find your own or somehow convince one of those mad bastards down by Shawshank
Docks to take you ...and they take a lot of convincing.\"

\"I'm sure we can work something out.\"

\"Try Ol' Gammy leg. She'd be the only one to dare do it.\"

At the docks... Calcubot spots what looks to be Ol Gammy Leg.

OPTIONS:
(1) Catch up to \"Ol' Gammy Leg\" and politely ask for her help
(2) Shout \"Ol' Gammy Leg!\" then ask for her help
(3) Shout \"Oi!\" and whistle at Gammy then demand her help"
end
