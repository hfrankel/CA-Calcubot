Our gang find themselves in Bladderpool. Alouise says she is going to go to
the Shady Pines Tavern to try get more information. She tells Calcubot to
stay where he is and not interact with anyone. Calcubot is looking around and
sees an old man motion towards him. Calcubot approaches.

The old man has a classic shell game in front of him and asks if Calcubot
wants to play. The min fee is 1 item and the old man will double whatever the
player gambles. An impossibly large younger man makes his way to
the shell game table.

\"Well Dad, looks like we got a player here. Sir, what's it gonna be?\"

OPTIONS:
(1) Politely decline
(2) Gamble with money you don't have
(3) Gamble with money you don't have ...arrogantly."
