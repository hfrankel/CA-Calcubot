Calcubot and Alouise are heading back to Gammy's ship.

\"The watch please?\"

Calcubot turns and Alouise has her staff pointed at in its direction.

\"Why?\"

\"Let's just say I don't enjoy the threat of being burned at the stake.
I figure I'll take my chances in some other time period.\"

Calcubot is frozen.

\"Now!\"
